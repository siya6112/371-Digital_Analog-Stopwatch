# 371-Digital_Analog-Stopwatch

Successfully designed and implemented a stopwatch on a DE1_SoC FPGA board using SystemVerilog  through Intel Quartus Prime software. The project included a digital display on 7-seg displays and an analog display on a VGA screen. Additionally, it featured a 15-, 30-, and 45-seconds countdown timer using different switch combinations and an LED indicating completion of the timer.
